# User-Review-Analysis
A Python-based analysis of student and employer reviews of their co-op experience.

This project analyzes student and employer reviews of the co-op experience, using text mining, sentiment analysis, and statistical techniques to extract insights. The goal is to evaluate preparedness, employer satisfaction, and the alignment between student expectations and employer needs.

Project Structure

This repository contains six Jupyter notebooks, each performing different analyses on the collected reviews:

**1. Co-op Preparedness Counts**

Purpose: Analyzes how prepared students felt for their co-op roles.

*Methods: Counts and visualizes preparedness scores from student reviews.*

Insights: Helps identify areas where students feel unprepared, guiding improvements in training.

**2. Employer Ratings**

Purpose: Analyzes employer satisfaction ratings given by students.

*Methods: Extracts and visualizes employer ratings from reviews.*

Insights: Provides a measure of employer experience and identifies trends in workplace satisfaction.

**3. Most Utilized Skills - Bigrams**

Purpose: Extracts the most frequently mentioned skills students used during co-ops.

*Methods: Text mining, bigram analysis, frequency distribution.*

Insights: Helps students and educators understand what skills are in demand.

**4. Overall Alignment Evaluation**

Purpose: Evaluates the alignment between student expectations and employer feedback.

*Methods: Data correlation, statistical comparison, visualization.*

Insights: Identifies gaps between student experiences and employer expectations.

**5. Skills Employers Seek**

Purpose: Identifies the top skills employers expect from co-op students.
